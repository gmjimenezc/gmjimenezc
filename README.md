## About me
I’m a DevOps Engineer who focuses on building reliable CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure, and improving platform reliability. I enjoy building automation and developer tooling, and learning about cloud-native systems and scalable infrastructure.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: ¨a finance management app¨
- 🌱 I’m learning: **how to take an app from idea to fully functional, to launch with real users**
- 💬 Ask me about: **Clouds (Azure, AWS, SAP E-Commerce), CI/CD (Github Workflows, Azure Pipelines, Gitlab pipelines, Jenkins), containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), automation with Python & Bash, IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation + Python CDK, Bicep), Ansible, etc.**
- 📫 How to reach me: gm.jmnzc@gmail.com / https://linkedin.com/in/gmjimenezc
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a musician and also write fantasy on my free time
